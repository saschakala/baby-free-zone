# BABY FREE ZONE

What's your favorite birth control method? Least favorite? What side effects did you experience? 

### What is BFZ?
BFZ is a way for uterus having individuals to keep track of all the birth controls they've tried over their lifetime, compare different options, and see what other people are saying.

### User Guide
Birth control reviews can be seen by anyone, but reviews can be left by users only. New birth controls can only be added by admins so as to prevent inaccuracies regarding dosage, ingredients, and generic names.

### Into the Future
Further development for BFZ includes further fleshing out the user model so that reviewers can add more personal information about themselves (any underlying conditions, whether they've had children, mental health diagnosis, etc) and then allowing for other users to sort reviews by these attributes. 

### Installation Guide
- Clone repository
- Run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems
- Start up a rails server (`rails s`)
- Either create an account or login to your existing account
- Start logging your reviews
